Housing Market prediction_California

California Real state

Our objective is to develop a predictive model for California housing, creating an opportunity for the general audience to explore ideal locations and estimated prices.

There are numerous factors that influence the value of a property, such as location, size, condition, and time. These factors can vary significantly from one property to another.

The housing market is inherently volatile and heavily influenced by fluctuations in supply and demand, as well as economic factors like interest rates and inflation. Predicting price changes over time is therefore quite challenging.




1. longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west
2. latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north
3. housingMedianAge: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building
4. totalRooms: Total number of rooms within a block
6. population: Total number of people residing within a block
7. households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block
8. medianIncome: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)
9. medianHouseValue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)
10. oceanProximity: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea

Does location, like ocean facing, affect pricing?
Will the housing market ever go with the negative trend?  
Required Household Income to Afford a Home in the location (By City)
